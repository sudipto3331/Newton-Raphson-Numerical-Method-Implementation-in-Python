# Newton Raphson Numerical Method Implementation in Python

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Newton-Raphson Method for finding roots of nonlinear equations. The code includes input validation, iteration, and termination based on the desired error or reaching the maximum number of iterations. Results are saved into an Excel file (`LAB3.xls`).

### Newton Raphson Method Theory
The Newton-Raphson Method is a root-finding algorithm which produces successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. The method uses the first derivative of the function to iteratively find the root.

**Steps:**
1. Choose an initial guess \( x_0 \).
2. Compute the next approximation using:
   \[
   x_{i+1} = x_i - \frac{f(x_i)}{f'(x_i)}
   \]
3. Repeat until the desired relative error is achieved or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

### Dependencies
To run this code, you need the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `math`
- `xlwt`
- `xlrd`
- `xlutils`

### Installation
To install the required libraries, you can use `pip`:
```sh
pip install numpy xlwt xlrd xlutils
```

### Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure the script and the Excel file (`LAB3.xls`) are in the same directory.
3. Run the script using Python:
    ```sh
    python newton_raphson_method.py
    ```
4. Provide the required inputs when prompted:
    - Enter the initial guess (\( x_0 \)).
    - Enter the desired percentage relative error.
    - Enter the number of iterations.

5. The script will compute the iterations and save the results in an Excel file named `LAB3.xls`.

### Code Explanation
The code begins by importing the necessary libraries and defining the function `func` and its derivative `derivFunc`. The main function `newtonRaphson` implements the Newton-Raphson Method, performing iterations, computing errors, and saving results in an Excel file.

Below is a snippet from the code illustrating the main logic:

```python
def func( x ):
    return x * x * x - x * x + 2

def derivFunc( x ):
    return 3 * x * x - 2 * x

def newtonRaphson(xi, err, ite):
    x_i = np.zeros([ite])
    x_r = np.zeros([ite])

    rel_err = np.zeros([ite])
    itern = np.zeros([ite])

    x_i[0] = xi

    h = func(xi) / derivFunc(xi)
    xi = xi - h
    x_r[0] = xi

    for i in range(ite-1):
        itern[i] = i + 1

        i = i + 1

        x_i[i] = x_r[i-1]
        h = func(x_i[i]) / derivFunc(x_i[i])
        x_r[i] = x_i[i] - h

        if i>0:
            rel_err[i] = abs(abs(x_r[i] - x_r[i-1]) / x_r[i]) * 100
        if all([i > 0, abs(rel_err[i]) < err]):
            break

    itern[i] = i + 1

    wb = Workbook()
    sheet1 = wb.add_sheet('Sheet 1')
    num_of_iter = i - 2

    sheet1.merge(0, 0, 1, 2)
    sheet1.write(0,1,'Newton Raphson',xlwt.easyxf("font: bold 1,height 250; align: horiz center"))

    sheet1.write(1,0,'Number of iteration')
    sheet1.write(1,1,'x_i')
    sheet1.write(1,2,'x_r')
    sheet1.write(1,3,'Relative error')

    for n in range(num_of_iter+2):
        sheet1.write(n+2,0,itern[n])
        sheet1.write(n+2,1,x_i[n])
        sheet1.write(n+2,2,x_r[n])
        sheet1.write(n+2,3,rel_err[n])

    sheet1.write(n+4,0,'The')
    sheet1.write(n+4,1,'root')
    sheet1.write(n+4,2,'is')
    sheet1.write(n+4,3,x_r[i])
    wb.save('LAB3.xls')
```

The code completes by saving the final results into the Excel file `LAB3.xls`.

### Example
Below is an example of how to use the script:

1. **Run the script**:
    ```sh
    python newton_raphson_method.py
    ```

2. **Enter the input values**:
    ```
    Enter initial guess: 1.5
    Enter desired percentage relative error: 0.001
    Enter number of iterations: 50
    ```

3. **Output**:
    - The script will compute the iterations using the Newton-Raphson Method and print intermediate results on the console.
    - The final results will be saved in an Excel file named `LAB3.xls`.

### Files in the Repository
- `newton_raphson_method.py`: The main script for performing the Newton-Raphson Method.
- `LAB3.xls`: Excel file generated by running the script.

### Input Parameters
The script prompts for the following input values:
- Initial guess (`xi`).
- Desired percentage relative error (`err`).
- Number of iterations (`ite`).

### Troubleshooting
1. **Initial Input Values**: Ensure that the initial guess is reasonably close to the actual root.
2. **Function Evaluation**: The function `x^3 - x^2 + 2` and its derivative `3*x^2 - 2*x` are hardcoded. Modify these functions as needed.
3. **Excel File Creation**: Ensure you have write permissions in the directory where the script is run to save the Excel file.
4. **Python Version**: This script is compatible with Python 3. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
